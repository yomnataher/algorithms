we will asuume that the normal toy will be 1 and the defected toy is 0.
we will put them in an array.
we can first sort them and using binary serch tree to find the defected toys it takes O(log n).
Or we can use Hashing table with chaining to solve the collisions .
Because we have values (0,1) only.
It will take O(1)
